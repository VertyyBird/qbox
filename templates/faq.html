        </div>
        <p>Avatar URLs must meet the following requirements:</p>
        <ul class="bulleted">
            <li>Host must be on the allowlist: <code>ibb.co</code>, <code>i.ibb.co</code>, <code>github.com</code>, <code>raw.githubusercontent.com</code>, <code>avatars.githubusercontent.com</code>, <code>user-images.githubusercontent.com</code>.</li>
            <li>File extension must end with <code>.png</code>, <code>.jpg</code>, <code>.jpeg</code>, <code>.gif</code>, or <code>.webp</code>.</li>
            <li>The URL must be accessible and respond with a successful status (we check with a quick HEAD/GET request and follow a single redirect).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If your link fails validation, double-check the host and that it points directly to an image file.</p>
