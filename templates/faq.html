        <div class="card-header">
            <div><strong>How do questions and anonymity work?</strong></div>
        </div>
        <p>You can post questions on someone’s profile whether you are logged in or not. Logged-out visitors ask anonymously by default; logged-in users can toggle anonymity before submitting.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="unanswered">
        <div class="card-header">
            <div><strong>Where do I find new questions?</strong></div>
        </div>
        <p>Your Dashboard shows unanswered questions sent to you. The header also shows a count of pending questions. Answering from the dashboard immediately publishes your response to your profile and the public feed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="permalinks">
        <div class="card-header">
            <div><strong>How do answer permalinks work?</strong></div>
        </div>
        <p>Each answer gets a shareable link at <code>/profile/&lt;username&gt;/a/&lt;id&gt;</code> using a non-sequential public ID. Anyone with the link can read that single answer, even if they aren’t logged in.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="avatar-rules">
        <div class="card-header">
            <div><strong>How do avatar URLs work?</strong></div>
        </div>
        <p>Avatar URLs must meet the following requirements:</p>
        <ul class="bulleted">
            <li>Host must be on the allowlist: <code>ibb.co</code>, <code>i.ibb.co</code>, <code>github.com</code>, <code>raw.githubusercontent.com</code>, <code>avatars.githubusercontent.com</code>, <code>user-images.githubusercontent.com</code>.</li>
            <li>File extension must end with <code>.png</code>, <code>.jpg</code>, <code>.jpeg</code>, <code>.gif</code>, or <code>.webp</code>.</li>
            <li>The URL must be accessible and respond with a successful status (we check with a quick HEAD/GET request and follow a single redirect).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If your link fails validation, double-check the host and that it points directly to an image file.</p>
    </div>
</div>
